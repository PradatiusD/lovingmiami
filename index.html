            <p class="lead">Loving Day is a network of celebrations of the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized interracial marriage in the U.S. It was founded 10 years ago by Ken Tanabe in New York City, and it has since expanded into a global network.</p>
            <p>This year, in Miami, we will celebrate Loving Day with an art exhibit and a panel discussion on interracial dating. The art exhibit, Mixed in Miami, is our reMIX of the Hapa Project, a multiracial identity project created by artist Kip Fulbeck. </p>
            <p>Our goal is to celebrate the diversity of experiences within the multiracial community while raising awareness of Americaâ€™s fastest growing demographic.</p>
